 The project developers

The project is developed by the second-year Information Technology students from Oulu University of Applied Sciences:

- **Ashif Moon**, [GitHub account]( https://github.com/AshifkhaMoon)
- **Lufei Wu**, [GitHub account]( https://github.com/lufeiwu22)
- **Minyi Zhang**, [GitHub account]( https://github.com/minyizhangg)
- **Ziqi Li**, [GitHub account]( https://github.com/ZiqiLi28)

Ashif Moon: Ashif Handles the development of fundamental components for the backend driver app, and refining the UI design of the consumer app.

Lufei Wu: Lufei Wu takes responsibilities for the frontend development of the Consumer App, and API tests.

Minyi Zhang: Minyi Zhang is charge in the frontend development of the Touch Screen App, Authentication for the consumer app and React tests.

Ziqi Li: Ziqi Li holds the reins in backend development, the dashboard page for both the driver and consumer.

In the development of our team's project, each member has assumed primary responsibilities. Simultaneously, everyone is engaged in tasks such as searching and discussing details taking on distinct functions in apps. We collaborate to aid the main responsible person in problem-solving when necessary. Everyone has been active equally.

Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a parcel locker system application which in total has three apps Consumer App, Driver App, Touch Screen Simulator also a Parcel Generator Robot. The Project enables users to register, log in, send and receive parcels, and keep track of the status of their parcels in the lockers and after that a driver will pick up the parcel and deliver it to its destination. The ultimate iteration of the system is intended for deployment on the public Internet. We have successfully accomplished the framework of our Advanced Web Application Development course.

Installation and Usage Guide (Local Deployment)
Follow these steps to get started with the app development:

1. Clone the repository which you want to develop:
   
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:
   
   ```bash
  cd Backend /ConsumerAppFrontend /DriverAppFrontend /touchScreenSimulator   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
  ```

1 Backend -> bash npm run create-driver  npm run create-locations  npm run dev 

2 ConsumerAppFrontend -> bash cd ConsumerAppFrontend  npm start 

3 DriverAppFrontend -> bash cd DriverAppFrontend  npm start 

4 touchScreenSimulator -> bash touchScreenSimulator npm Start  

5 Robot -> bash  cd Backend npm run run-robot

**** - Note: You might need to modify the .env files to run the Project. The above steps may need to be adjusted depending on the environment. ****
